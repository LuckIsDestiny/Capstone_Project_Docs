\section{Goal}
SpendSmart is a secure, full-stack web application that empowers users to manage their personal finances by automatically importing bank transactions, categorizing expenses, setting budgets, tracking financial goals, and interacting with an AI-powered financial chatbot. The system integrates with banking APIs and offers real-time insights and personalized financial advice. Admins oversee user management and platform health to ensure system security, performance, and compliance.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User registration and login with role-based access (User/Admin)
    \item Secure bank account linking via external APIs (e.g., Plaid)
    \item Automated transaction fetching and intelligent expense categorization
    \item Budget planning module with customizable limits per category
    \item Spending dashboard with charts, summaries, and monthly/yearly reports
    \item Savings goal creation and progress tracking modules
    \item AI-powered chatbot for financial advice using Ollama LLM
    \item Email notifications (e.g., budget limit warning, goal achievements) using Nodemailer
    \item Admin dashboard to monitor users, platform usage, and system activities
    \item Role management (admin can promote, suspend, or delete users)
    \item API Gateway management with Express Gateway for service routing, load balancing, and basic security policies
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure authentication using JWT tokens and OAuth for bank API access
    \item Data encryption (both in transit via HTTPS and at rest using database encryption techniques)
    \item Responsive and intuitive UI/UX optimized for web and mobile browsers
    \item Scalable microservices backend (Node.js, Express.js) to handle growing transaction data and user load
    \item Real-time synchronization with banking APIs for transaction updates
    \item High availability and low-latency backend API responses
    \item Fault tolerance and graceful error handling for API and system failures
    \item Compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
    \item Audit trails and logging for security incidents and critical activities
    \item Modular architecture for easier maintenance, upgrades, and feature expansion
\end{itemize}
